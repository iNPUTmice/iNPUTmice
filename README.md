# Hi, I’m Daniel 🤝

I’ve been a freelance software developer for 15+ years. My main interests are in open standards and communication protocols (Instant Messaging, E-mail, Fediverse). I’m the project lead on [Conversations](https://codeberg.org/inputmice/Conversations) and [Ltt.rs](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android).

Most of my open source projects are hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/inputmice/) ⛰️.
